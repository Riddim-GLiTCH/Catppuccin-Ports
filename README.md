[Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin/) is a community-driven pastel theme that aims to be the middle ground between low and high contrast themes. It consists of 4 soothing warm flavors with 26 eye-candy colors each, perfect for coding, designing, and much more! In addition, this repository contains unofficial ports of the theme to Riddim=GLiTCH's Most-used websites, applications and similar themable instances, that do not already have a cattpuccin theme.

Currently in-development ports are:
- [The Custom Mario Kart Wiiki](https://wiki.tockdom.com) (~~See Folder~~ IN DEVELOPMENT, CHECK BACK LATER.)
- [Riddim-GLiTCH's Personal Website](https://riddim-glitch.is-a.dev) (Pending Rewrite. Will use the Catppuccin Mocha-Red Color scheme for its next appearance)
- Mario Kart Wii (Menu assets, And Race UI files will be on a seperate repo)
